# We Have We Need

We Have We Need (WHWN) intends to alleviate operational stress regarding
inventory management by providing a digital solution that can be deployed
on site, on the cloud, or both. With better inventory management, supply
coordinators can better understand the flow of supplies into and out of their
organizations. We Have We Need can generate powerful charts that can help
supply coordinators discover and predict supply surplus and famine.
